      <h2>Internship</h2>
      <p>
       
      I have interned in USA based startup Botzee. Now I am employed here as a Fulltimer. I am glad I got
this opportunity. We are a small company but solving big challenges.I
am currently working on Hotel reservation mobile application which will
be launched on playstore and appstore. The tech stack which we have
used here is django, angular, ionic, sql. I have handled all the backend
application and mostly worked on django. I have implemented
geofencing with the help of angular. This technology issues Room
key(QR code) to the user once it is inside the hotel premises.
